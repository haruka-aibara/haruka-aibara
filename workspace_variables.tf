# Workspace environment variables
# =========================================
# The github provider reads GitHub App credentials from GITHUB_APP_* environment
# variables, so switching away from a PAT needs no provider block change.
#
# What these credentials are, and why the setup looks like this:
# docs/reference/github-authentication.md
#
# Terraform declares these variables; the UI holds their values. The placeholder
# below is written once, at creation, and is then left alone: HCP Terraform never
# returns a sensitive variable's value, so the provider carries the last known
# state value forward on every read and only ever writes a new one if `value`
# changes here. No ignore_changes is needed for that — it is how the provider
# treats sensitive variables.
#
# The consequence is that Terraform cannot see these values at all. It will not
# detect a key cleared or corrupted in the UI, and a plan stays clean either way.
#
# The private key has to be handled this way, since a value written here would
# land in state. The ids do not — only the private key can sign a token request,
# so neither identifier opens anything on its own — but they take the same shape
# so there is one rule rather than two, and so this public repository names
# nothing about the organization's App.

# Same reasoning as the GitHub App variables above: HCP Terraform never
# returns a sensitive variable's value, so these are declared once with a
# placeholder and the real value is set in the UI afterward.
#
# AWS itself is authenticated via dynamic provider credentials (OIDC), not
# static keys -- see providers.tf -- so there is no AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID /
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY here.
#
# ignore_changes on value: these two were created by hand in the UI before
# this code landed, so they were adopted with an `import` block (see
# imports_2026.tf) rather than created fresh. HCP Terraform never returns a
# sensitive value, so after import the provider has no way to know it already
# matches "set-in-ui" and would otherwise plan to overwrite the real secret
# with the placeholder. ignore_changes makes that impossible, since neither
# is meant to be written from code again after their first value is set in
# the UI.
